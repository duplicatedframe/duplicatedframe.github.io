                    <p>I joined the team at Babeltime Inc. to both design and implement heroes, levels, and systems
                      during the third year of live operations of their first mobile game, Realm Defense. Realm Defense
                      is a free-to-play tower defense game with light hero collecting elements. It has been featured
                      many times on both the App Store and Google Play as a noteworthy offline game.</p>

                    <p>Working on Realm Defense has been my first experience of supporting a game post-launch. In the
                      time since joining the team, my role has grown to include communicating with our most active
                      players on social media, developing and balancing campaign levels, introducing new resources and
                      meta-systems, and both designing and implementing unique new hero units.</p>
                    <p>Working to put out weekly patches of both content and bug-fixes happens at such a breakneck speed
                      in the world of free to play, and I never could've imagined how much of a toll that takes before
                      entering this position. However, the direct and actionable feedback from our player base allows
                      for a thrilling amount of iterative polish and expansion that's difficult to oversell. The
                      opportunity to have so many hands pushing the limits of my designs has helped me to see the
                      importance of robust testing and the utility of complex, interconnected systems.</p>

                    <p>The fast-paced development of Realm Defense mixed with its long period of operation meant that
                      the project was severely underdocumented at the time of my on-boarding. By necessity, I developed
                      strategies for researching across our commit history, social media, and player-generated content
                      for clues about past design decisions to fill in the gaps where institutional knowledge came up
                      short. In addition to researching and building out the project's documentation, I've gotten to
                      build spreadsheets and external tools to assist in the analysis and generation of content of all
                      types.</p>

                    <p>Tori is a game where players fly as a bird through mystical floating islands channeling the
                      musical spirits of the objects that once inhabited the land. By exploring and discovering these
                      spirits, they return life and music to the land.</p>
                    <p>With our small, inexperienced team, my role changed by necessity to include programming, 3D
                      modeling, and project managing on top of my primary work as a designer. Getting a chance to touch
                      so many parts of the project was truly valuable in furthering my understanding of what kinds of
                      work each member of our small dev team did on a day to day basis. Many of the lessons I learned in
                      addition to this can be split into three main categories: working on a team, maintaining a vision
                      while iterating, and adapting to challenges along the way.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-teamwork" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-teamwork-tab">
                    <p>One of the most difficult parts of working on Tori was the everchanging team dynamic. The project
                      started out with a team of four that never really planned on seeing the project through to
                      release. After three of those team members graduated, I (with permission from the original project
                      owner) repitched the project in an attempt to build a new team. Two people began to work with me
                      then, and five more members joined Team Tori over the course of development.</p>
                    <p>Before Tori, the longest I had worked on a single project was a couple of months, and I almost
                      always knew the people that I was working alongside. I was scared out of my mind that working on
                      this project for <strong>years</strong> with people I had never worked with would be impossible.
                      At the beginning of the project, this seemed to be confirmed when myself and a teammate simply
                      could not get along. Not only was their vision of what the project would become drastically
                      different from my own, but differences in the ways we communicated stood in the way of us being
                      open to each others' ideas. The road to fixing this working relationship long and winding, but I'm
                      very happy with the work we were able to do together in the end.</p>
                    <p>Not all problems with teammates worked out this smoothly. After a period of radio silence from
                      one team member, I and the rest of the team decided to kick them off of the project. We reached
                      out to them many times throughout this silence in an attempt to communicate concern rather than
                      contempt and met with some of our Game Design professors to discuss ways of revitalizing that
                      member's enthusiasm for the project, yet nothing changed. It was very difficult to remove them
                      from our team and there were definitely hard feelings, but we were able to restore a professional
                      relationship with them in the end.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-vision" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-vision-tab">
                    <p>A huge requirement of making development happen with a team of any size is an ability to
                      communicate a consistent vision for the project. This became most clear in the process of working
                      with a video editor to make the <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5zRfCIj7o">IGF trailer for our
                        game</a>. The video itself was filmed and edited during the two days leading up to the deadline
                      for submission. This required presenting the editor with a fairly clear idea of what the final
                      video needed to look like so no major revisions would be necessary. This gave me the chance to try
                      my hand at storyboarding. I learned the basics of how to communicate the motion of objects, the
                      motion of the camera, and how to communicate a feeling through a sequence of images that have
                      drastically improved my ability to quickly and accurately communicate my designs during meetings.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is in these meetings that I learned the most about communicating ideas. We met four or five
                      times a week, and I originally thought we would be running out of things to talk about early in
                      development, but this was certainly not the case. We were always hoping to discuss far more than
                      we had time for, and this necessitated learning to communicate concisely. It taught us the
                      importance of keeping a record of our conversations and our ideas, and most importantly, it taught
                      us to always think passively about our ideas so that we can be prepared to talk about them at any
                      time.</p>
                    <p>As a result of this, we began pitching our game all the time. I ran our game concept by someone
                      outside of the team at least once a day. While I knew that this would make it easier to present
                      the game in the future, I didn't know that it would help me to understand when we were making
                      decisions that were not right for the game. Telling someone our concept forced me to have a pretty
                      good idea of what was at the core of the project, and that truly came in handy when thinking about
                      whether proposed changes were ultimately good for the project.</p>

                    <p>As our team size fluctuated between three to seven members, so did our needs. My original goal
                      for the project was to focus on developing the game's concept -- to iterate and expand upon the
                      most energizing bits. Very early on, it became clear that this was not going to be enough when we
                      lacked a programmer; so, I shifted to doing more implementation for a short time to enable us to
                      test our ideas and iterate faster. Though this put some unwanted distance between myself and the
                      game's direction, I'm thankful that I ended up taking on those tasks as they allowed me to better
                      communicate with the team about new concepts we eventually implemented in the game.</p>
                    <p>Later in development, a member of our team decided to shift their involvement from environmental
                      modeling to a focus on characters. To keep the timeline of our team on track, I took up some of
                      their original work with the game's environments. Though I'm certainly not a 3D Artist, filling in
                      worked out very well for our team and drastically increased the original Environment Artist's
                      morale.</p>

                    <p>Window is an interactive fiction that explores the role of perspective during the end of a
                      relationship. In it, I experimented in limiting players' awareness of the effects they are having
                      on the game's narrative. The game is loosely based on my experience of a breakup with a long-term
                      partner.</p>

                    <p>In creating this project, I began to worry that players would find the story or the lack of
                      action boring. To my surprise, however, it seemed that players were enthralled by the story that
                      the game was telling through its mechanics. One player even began to cry (even if only for a
                      moment).</p>
                    <p>I have loved games as a medium for producing more than just fun for quite a long time. Finding
                      some small amount of success in this with Window really convinced me to dive head first into game
                      design.</p>

                    <p>Two Hundred Seventy Three is an interactive fiction where players take the role of an unaware
                      audience member during a performance of John Cage's 4' 33". My goal in designing it was to push
                      the lower limit of stimuli for player interactions.</p>

                    <p>For a majority of the two hundred seventy three seconds that this game lasts, nothing new is
                      presented to the player. When information is presented to the player, it is done to encourage the
                      player to sit still, take in their environment, and note that, in this moment, their choice to
                      abstain from interacting with the game a way of interacting with the game as well.</p>
                    <p>I've loved 4'33" for a very long time now, and finding a way to make it into a game is one of the
                      first ideas I had that was related to game design. Unfortunately, this didn't work as well as I
                      had hoped. Players became quite confused about their role in the game, and tended to tune the game
                      out. I hope to revisit this concept in the future.</p>

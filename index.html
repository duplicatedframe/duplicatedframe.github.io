                                            <p>With our relatively small team size, my role has changed by necessity to include programming, 3D modeling, and project managing on top of my primary work of designing. This has been truly valuable in furthering my understanding of what kinds of work each member of a small dev team does on a day to day basis. Many of the lessons I've learned in addition to this can be split into three main categories: working on a team, maintaining a vision while iterating, and adapting to challenges along the way.</p>

                                            <p>Before Tori, the longest I had worked on a single project was probably a couple of months, and I almost always knew the people that I worked with. I was scared out of my mind that working on this project for <strong>years</strong> with people I had never worked with would be impossible. And, to be fair, there were definitely bumps along the way. At the beginning of the project, myself and one other teammate simply could not get along. Not only was their vision of what the project would become drastically different from my own, but differences in the way we communicated stood in the way of us being open to each others' ideas.</p>

                                            <p>Window is an interactive fiction that explores the role of perspective during the end of a relationship. In it, I experimented in limiting players' awareness of the effects they are having on the game's narrative. The game is loosely based on my experience of a breakup with a long-term partner.</p>
                                            <p>It can be downloaded <a href="https://iu.app.box.com/v/windowGame">here</a>.</p>
                                            <p>In this project, limited control is given to players that are making their way through the narrative. As the story progresses, the only thing players are capable of doing is shifting focus between different reflections in a window. Doing so changes the outcome of the story without signaling to the player that any changes have occured. This allows for players to have control over the narrative while thinking that things could have never happened any other way. Only in discussing their experience with others will they recognize that they had played a part in directing their experience.</p>
                                            <p>I made this game in a very emotionally difficult time in my life, and it definitely shows. The game is quite short and very unpolished, but it remains as my favorite completed project. The game explores the type of story that I find myself most interested in. It focuses on the world itself, the context for the players' actions. In doing so, it brings me back to the moment of my own breakup. It makes me remember the way I didn't want to look into the eyes of my former partner, the way I gripped the cover of the futon, and the slow, sad walk home.</p>
                                            <p>In creating this project, I began to worry that players would find the story or the lack of action boring. To my surprise, however, it seemed that players were enthralled by the story that the game was telling through its mechanics. One player even began to cry (even if only for a moment).</p>
                                            <p>I have loved games as a medium for producing more than just fun for quite a long time. This project really taught me that this  direction of games moving from being consumable goods to works of art is something that is within reach. It is this realization that really convinced me to dive head first into game design.</p>

                                        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="more-273" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="more-273-tab">
                                            <p>Two Hundred Seventy Three is an interactive fiction where players take the role of an unaware audience member during a performance of John Cage's 4' 33". My goal in designing it was to push the lower limit of stimuli for player interactions.</p>
                                            <p>It can be downloaded <a href="https://iu.app.box.com/v/twohundredseventythreeGame">here</a>.</p>
                                            <p>For a majority of the two hundred seventy three seconds that this game lasts, nothing new is presented to the player. When information is presented to the player, it is done to encourage the player to sit still, take in their environment, and note that, in this moment, their choice to abstain from interacting with the game a way of interacting with the game as well.</p>
                                            <p>I have loved the concept of 4'33" for a very long time now, and finding a way to make it into a game is one of the first ideas I had that was related to game design. I became fascinated by a game system just sitting there passively, doing nothing at all until the player makes a move. One way this is represented in the game is by text streaming out on a timer until the player rudely interrupts the show. Unfortunately, this didn't work as well as I had hoped. Players became quite confused about their role in the game, and tended to tune the game out. I hope to revisit this concept very soon.</p>

                                            <p>Lacking Depth is a game in which players play a character trapped within a painting. Every few seconds the player will switch from platforming their way out of this painting to playing a top down adventure game and avoiding monsters scattered throughout the painting. Escape the frame to win.</p>

                  <p>Games hold a special place in my heart. In my famliy, gatherings have always been built around playing games. Countless nights were spent crowded around a table playing Uno, LCR, or (our personal favorite) SolarQuest. Most weekends revolved around playing the game that my grandparents had rented for my cousins and I. The number of AA batteries that were depleted by my nonstop Pokemon playing is astonishing. Games weren't only the way that I spent my free time, they were how I related to those around me.</p>
                  <p>As "gamer" became a label for someone who played Halo, Call of Duty, or GTA for hours and hours alone in their room, I fell out of love with the medium. I spent a few years unsuccessfully searching for an identity outside of the culture that surrounded these games before returning to get deeply involved with the communities of League of Legends and Minecraft during the last couple years of highschool. Though the communities for both of these games are known to have their fair share of problems, it was through them that I was able to find friends that defined themselves as more than just gamers. I made friends who were atheletes, painters, and musicians. These friends brought me to universities, art museums, concerts, and competitions that I would have never thought to attend on my own.
                  <p>I hope now to make something to contribute to their fields. I want to show researchers, artists, philosophers, writers, musicians, and more that they should be interested in what is going on in games. I want to be a part of the groups that are currently pushing the medium of games forward toward cultural legitimacy. I want to be a part of teams making games that allow players to interact with them in ways that cause them to feel, consider, change, and discover things about themselves.</p>

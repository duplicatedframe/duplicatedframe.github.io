                                            <p>Tori is a game where players fly as a bird through mystical floating islands channeling the musical spirits of the objects that once inhabited the land. By exploring and discovering these spirits, return life and music to the land.</p>
                                            <p>With our relatively small team size, my role has changed by necessity to include programming, 3D modeling, and project managing on top of my primary work of designing. This has been truly valuable in furthering my understanding of what kinds of work each member of a small dev team does on a day to day basis. Many of the lessons I've learned in addition to this can be split into three main categories: <a href="#toriTeamwork">working on a team</a>, <a href="#toriVision">maintaining a vision while iterating</a>, and <a href="#toriAdapting">adapting to challenges along the way</a>.</p>

                                            <p>Before Tori, the longest I had worked on a single project was probably a couple of months, and I almost always knew the people that I worked with. I was scared out of my mind that working on this project for <strong>years</strong> with people I had never worked with would be impossible. And, to be fair, there were definitely bumps along the way. At the beginning of the project, myself and one other teammate simply could not get along. Not only was their vision of what the project would become drastically different from my own, but differences in the way we communicated stood in the way of us being open to each others' ideas.</p>

                                  <p>I am currently the team’s lead and a designer on the project, but it is worth noting that Tori was not my project from the start.</p>
                                  <p>Chris Wiley presented the original idea for Tori in a design class at Indiana University. After his pitch, myself and two others joined his team to flesh out a design document for the game under the assumption that it would never actually be made. Our ideas were all over the place and the scope of the project (if the game were to ever actually be made) ballooned to an incredible size, but we didn’t recognize this at the time. During our push to the end of the semester (and the subsequent graduation all of the team’s members other than myself), we became incredibly excited about the concept and decided to work on it into the summer.</p>
                                  <p>This didn’t happen.</p>
                                  <p>I was then approached by the head of the Game Design program and asked to present Tori to the </p>

                  <p>Games hold a special place in my heart. In my famliy, gatherings have always been built around playing games. Countless nights were spent crowded around a table playing Uno, LCR, or (our personal favorite) SolarQuest. Most weekends revolved around playing the game that my grandparents had rented for my cousins and I. The number of AA batteries that were depleted by my nonstop Pokemon playing is astonishing. Games weren't only the way that I spent my free time, they were how I related to those around me.</p>
                  <p>As "gamer" became a label for someone who played Halo, Call of Duty, or GTA for hours and hours alone in their room, I fell out of love with the medium. I spent a few years unsuccessfully searching for an identity outside of the culture that surrounded these games before returning to get deeply involved with the communities of League of Legends and Minecraft during the last couple years of highschool. Though the communities for both of these games are known to have their fair share of problems, it was through them that I was able to find friends that defined themselves as more than just gamers. I made friends who were atheletes, painters, and musicians. These friends brought me to universities, art museums, concerts, and competitions that I would have never thought to attend on my own.
                  <p>I hope now to make something to contribute to their fields. I want to show researchers, artists, philosophers, writers, musicians, and more that they should be interested in what is going on in games. I want to be a part of the groups that are currently pushing the medium of games forward toward cultural legitimacy. I want to be a part of teams making games that allow players to interact with them in ways that cause them to feel, consider, change, and discover things about themselves.</p>
